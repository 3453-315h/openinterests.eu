## OpenInterests

The intent of this project is to create a simplified, searchable
presentation of actors and relationships involved in EU politics and
institutions. In particular, the database will include: 

* Information from the register of interests (lobby register)
* Personnel information from the register of EP accredditations
* Expense information from the EC's financial transparency system
* Potentially: contract awards made by EU institutions


As a secondary objective, the site's software will be built to be 
re-usable as a data graph storage.
